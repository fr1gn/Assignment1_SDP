# Cinema Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a **Cinema Management System** made in Java. It handles important tasks like adding movies, booking tickets, creating a user interface, and managing movie schedules. The project uses five design patterns to make everything work:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Manages the systemâ€™s settings.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Creates different types of movies (like Regular or IMAX).
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Builds user interface elements (like buttons) with different themes (Dark or Light).
- **Builder Pattern**: Helps create ticket bookings (choosing movie, seat, and snacks).
- **Prototype Pattern**: Copies and manages movie schedules.
